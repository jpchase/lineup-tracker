# Developing

To develop:

1. Clone the repository.
1. To install node packages, run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
1. Start the development server by running:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   This will print the address of locally-hosted site, usually: `http://localhost:8080/`.
   Changes to code will be auto-detected, and should refresh the page.
